" <filename>``) or, if you don't have a .vimrc file, you can just symlink to it
" (``ln -s <this file> ~/.vimrc``).  All options are protected by autocmds
" (read below for an explanation of the command) so blind sourcing of this file

" adjusting settings for Python and C files.

" The following section contains suggested settings.  While in no way required
" to meet coding standards, they are helpful.

" Set the default file encoding to UTF-8:
set encoding=utf-8

" Puts a marker at the beginning of the file to differentiate between UTF and
" UCS encoding (WARNING: can trick shells into thinking a text file is actually
" a binary file when executing the text file): ``set bomb``

" For full syntax highlighting:
let python_highlight_all=1
syntax on

" Automatically indent based on file type:
filetype plugin indent on
" Keep indentation level from previous line:
set autoindent

" Folding based on indentation: ``set foldmethod=indent``

" Line numbers!
set number
" This line will do relative line numbering
" set relativenumber
